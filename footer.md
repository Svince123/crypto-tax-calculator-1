## Thank you

Thank you for using my program!

This software comes with no warranty.
In particular, I am not an accountant, and I make no warranty on the validity of the results that are produced by this software.
However, I have used it to calculate the capital gains for my own Canadian taxes.

If this software is useful to you, and you want to provide renumeration, then I'm thankful.
